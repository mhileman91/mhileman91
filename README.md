Hi there. My name is Matt Hileman. I'm an aspiring Data Scientist/Engineer. Python is my mother tongue but I enjoy working with HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQL, Excel, and C/Rust.

- I am in training right now to become a Certified Scrum Master and I have 5+ years of experience in team and project management. My hope is to secure a project management role within a data team or something similar.

- I have no idea how to close VIM. I keep having to Google it, but I never remember the keystrokes when it accidentally opens once in a blue moon. Honestly, I probably should just put a post-it note on my monitor at this point. I use Gitbash and VSCode for commit messages because, why not? It's already open anyway.

- I'm also interested in learning more about cloud computing in Azure and SaaS/PaaS models.
